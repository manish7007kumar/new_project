    <!-- c)	Create two paragraphs and write some text about Front end and back end.  -->
     <p><strong>Front-end development</strong>  is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour and interactivity.</p>
     <p>The<strong> backend</strong> is the server side of the website. It manages data and ensures everything on the frontend works properly. Users don't see or interact directly with the backend; it's the behind-the-scenes functionality</p>
